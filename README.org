#+TITLE: socket-based command runner
#+TAGS: utilities
#+AUTHOR: Ed Langley

** Introduction

Run a command everytime a line is written to a unix socket, passing
the line written as the last argument to the command. Useful in an
=after-save-hook= in emacs to run tests after the buffer is saved.
Unlike file-watchers, this allows more precise control of when the
tests are run, reducing the amount of time spent configuring ignore
files and waiting for spurious reruns.

** Building

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :results output :post proc
  zig build --verbose 2>&1
#+END_SRC

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh
rm /tmp/jest.sock ; $OLDPWD/zig-out/bin/zig-test /tmp/jest.sock npx jest --
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: proc
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports none

             for new = (funcall fn inp)
             until (equal new old)
             finally (cl-return new)))
